1494713997,"Thank you for this piece. Intersected with my own memories from about the same period when my late wife and I lived in Tianjin and I taught at Nankai University and she at a foreign languages middle school, first 1985-87, then 1990-91 w/ '88-89 summer back for shorter visits. Regular trips up to Beijing allowed us time to see many of the places you note. The area of  Ritan Park you describe was a favorite place. Even shortly after June 6, 1989 (I think in fact June 7-9) when we stayed at the Ritan Hotel briefly in the wake of the demonstrations and killings, the area brought a certain calmness that disappeared as we walked toward Jianguomen Wai DaJie. I appreciate your memories and sentiments.

Although I spent most of my time each trip in Hubei Province studying T'aiji at Wudangshan, each trip I arrived and departed from Beijing and chose to spend several days in the city. I always stayed in a hostel located in one or another hutongs on the west side. My favorite park was Yuetan where the Temple of the Moon is located. It's quite and very quiet - except most mornings between 10AM and noon a singer from the Beijing Opera performed with a small ensemble of Chinese musical instruments. It was fascinating, even enthralling. The entry cost was 10 Quai (about $1.65).<br/>As for the pollution there, it varied quite a bit. In early Autumn and Spring the sky was sometimes amazingly clear. At the end of November 2015 however the pollution was so thick that after we boarded our plane to leave for Seattle we were not cleared for takeoff for about twenty minutes.<br/>Beijing has riches, but it can be overwhelmingly bewildering due to its size and complexity.

The city was founded - not that long ago, certainly by Chinese history's standards - by nomadic non-Han people, mostly Manchus and Mongols, up in the northern grasslands and plateaus where 'they' (Manchus, Mongols) felt at home. It represents quite a stark departure - in location, vegetation and climate - from the long and ancient Chinese tradition of setting up the capital cities in the much more congenial South (e.g. Nanjing). <br/><br/>The weather alone says it all: Every September, local residents will remark cheerfully that ""Tianqi bu leng, ye bu re -- hen shufu!""

1494120025,"Sorry. I have to emphatically disagree. Although Beijing has many nice days (and many bad days) pollution wise, it is very difficult to predict when air quality will be good or bad - making it difficult to plan a trip. In the 1980s, September and October were characterized by predictably beautiful weather so fall was the prime season to visit Beijing. Now, however, even September and October don't have predictably good air. One of the worst bouts of pollution I remember here in Beijing was a few years ago in late October. Spring is also not dependably good. Two days ago, the air quality index spiked to about 560 or so - far, far above what is acceptable by WHO standards. Summer tends to be fairly bad (muggy, polluted and still) and late fall and parts of winter are often polluted, too. Last December-January saw a stretch of 10 days or so of really bad pollution. In fact, bad air pollution is increasingly common from late October until the air gets really cold - around early to mid-January. So, yes, you can have a nice visit to Beijing if your roll of the dice turns out well. But it's also very possible that the 4-5 days you allot for your visit will be be during a stretch of terrible or merely bad pollution.

Over the last few years New York Transit has invested millions in the new sleek double size buses. What good are they if they don't serve the public's needs? Riders complain that the wait for buses is maddening even when compared to the wait for trains. And now with Select buses riders are required to purchase their tickets and special kiosks and cannot board a bus without a special ticket.  Select buses are meant to speed up the movement of buses as money and metrocards cannot be used on them. (payment is made in advance of boarding).

1493649641,"Number of trains per hour (TPH) used to be 30 or more in rush hour on all major lines as far back as the 70's. Three things not tied into antiquated signaling have conspired to reduce this number:<br/>    (1) changes in passenger riding patterns - there has been a flattening out between rush hours and midday/weekends - fewer passengers in rush hours and more in the other periods.  Back in the sixties, large numbers of trains were routinely sidelined during midday and weekends because they weren't needed.  This probably made overall maintenance easier as equipment wasn't on the road as constantly.  Rush hours are just as crowded today but with fewer TPH needed, until now.<br/>    (2) Passenger behavior - the dwell time at stations has increased.  Observe how long it takes from the first time a conductor tries to close the train's door until it actually leaves the station.  Passengers know they can block doors with impunity and they will be reopened.  This needs to change in order to speed things up and increase capacity.<br/>    (3) Operator behavior - a series of operator-caused accidents over the years resulted in the elimination of routine ""keying-by"" of red signals, allowing trains to (slowly) get closer to each other, generally near stations in rush hour.  This, coupled with some maddening speed restrictions, further reduces capacity.

1493648882,"And yet since I moved to NYC in 1995 the cost of a ride has doubled.  In twenty years   And the $15 price of coming into Manhattan over a bridge is up there in the stratosphere beyond outrageous--especially for people who live here and use those bridges every...single...day.    I know there are mystical, magical forces at play here which I can never understand.  But to the layman, these astonishing, backbreaking, outlandish increases seem jaw-droppingly unfair, especially in light of our ability to physically--and oh so lamentably--compare our NYC mass transit experiences with those in other states and countries.

Yet, we give the state - (Cuomo &amp; NY Democrats!) billions for the MTA, along with $120/month, along with outrageous tolls on bridges - $17 for the Verrazano?!

1493648750,"As a native New Yorker I mourn the lack of progress in our infrastructure. We have so much talent, tech savvy and brawn in our nation and yet year after decade after decade we have poured trillions into weaponry. A product that makes us less safe as we build more of it and one that has no purpose but destroy and to enrich the few. When are we going to build again?  I can only hope for an awakening. We should have modern trains. New York transit needs an overhaul (LA and SF too). Bullet rail, monorail, and a subway for the premiere city of the world that would be on par with the great subway systems of the world. And subway stations that are modernized as well.
