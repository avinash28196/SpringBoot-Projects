The point that China had other, older capitals, is actually mentioned in the article, but isn''t part of the article--it never said that Beijing is China''s oldest capital.<br/>   The fact that Beijing was founded by Mongolians is irrelevant, as is the weather. What does matter is that it has been the capital of the place we now call China for almost all of the past 800 years. As for the south being more typical of where Chinese capitals were based, this is clearly wrong. Nanjing was a capital of China for a tiny amount of time (for one emperor at the start of the Ming and for a decade in the Republican era). The great historic capitals were overwhelmingly northern cities: Chang''an (Xi''an), Luoyang, Kaifeng, and, longest of all, Beijing.',3);

Although Beijing has many nice days (and many bad days) pollution wise, it is very difficult to predict when air quality will be good or bad - making it difficult to plan a trip. In the 1980s, September and October were characterized by predictably beautiful weather so fall was the prime season to visit Beijing. Now, however, even September and October don''t have predictably good air. One of the worst bouts of pollution I remember here in Beijing was a few years ago in late October. Spring is also not dependably good. Two days ago, the air quality index spiked to about 560 or so - far, far above what is acceptable by WHO standards. Summer tends to be fairly bad (muggy, polluted and still) and late fall and parts of winter are often polluted, too. Last December-January saw a stretch of 10 days or so of really bad pollution. In fact, bad air pollution is increasingly common from late October until the air gets really cold - around early to mid-January. So, yes, you can have a nice visit to Beijing if your roll of the dice turns out well. But it''s also very possible that the 4-5 days you allot for your visit will be be during a stretch of terrible or merely bad pollution. Even if the pollution isn''t hazardous, average air quality in Beijing isn''t healthful.',5);

He obviously failed in its endeavour, resulting in Confucianism and numerous archaic cultural practices coming back with a vengeance. For example, women are less equal now than during the Maoist years. Parents of the groom need to pay for an apartment, and possibly for a car before the parents of the bride accept the marriage proposal. I am not a defender of Mao, but he tried to get rid of the burden of history. If China is not careful in addressing this situation, the West will remain the implicit role model of the Chinese.

It all depends on how it''s done. <br/><br/>The real benefit of new signaling these days is that complete driverless operation is possible, especially if you time it with delivery of new vehicles. Yet NYCT did not do this on the L, which was a mistake. They can increase capacity with current signaling, but they don''t have people in the right positions who know how to do this.<br/><br/>The reason all the things I am saying don''t get much visibility is that NYCT does not have many talented people working there.

Three things not tied into antiquated signaling have conspired to reduce this number:<br/>    (1) changes in passenger riding patterns - there has been a flattening out between rush hours and midday/weekends - fewer passengers in rush hours and more in the other periods.  Back in the sixties, large numbers of trains were routinely sidelined during midday and weekends because they weren''t needed.  This probably made overall maintenance easier as equipment wasn''t on the road as constantly.  Rush hours are just as crowded today but with fewer TPH needed, until now.<br/>    (2) Passenger behavior - the dwell time at stations has increased.  Observe how long it takes from the first time a conductor tries to close the train''s door until it actually leaves the station.  Passengers know they can block doors with impunity and they will be reopened.  This needs to change in order to speed things up and increase capacity.<br/>    (3) Operator behavior - a series of operator-caused accidents over the years resulted in the elimination of routine "keying-by" of red signals, allowing trains to (slowly) get closer to each other, generally near stations in rush hour.

After that, move on to the remaining line segments with multiple services: Eastern Pkwy (2345), Brighton (BQ), Fulton (AC), 4th Ave (DNR), Culver (FG), Jamaica (JMZ) lines in Brooklyn; Jerome Ave (4), White Plains Road (25), Pelham (6), and Concourse (BD) in the Bronx; the 23 in Manhattan; and the NW in Queens. Then, the single-service ends of lines: the A, C, F, G J, M, N, and R trains in Brooklyn, the 2 and 5 in the Bronx, the E, F, G, M in Queens; and the 1, A, C in Manhattan.<br/><br/>This is a huge amount of work, but there''s no point in starting (for example) working on the 6th ave line with the end of the M in Middle Village! The trunk lines have to be first, as they need the highest capacity. The upgrades can radiate out from there. This has the added benefit of relying on the redundancy of the Manhattan lines to alleviate the pain. With real investments in physically separated bus lanes on the streets and bridges in the densest parts of town and five-boro bike infrastructure, NYC could transform itself into a city that doesn''t need cars.',11);
