Regular trips up to Beijing allowed us time to see many of the places you note. The area of  Ritan Park you describe was a favorite place. Even shortly after June 6, 1989 (I think in fact June 7-9) when we stayed at the Ritan Hotel briefly in the wake of the demonstrations and killings, the area brought a certain calmness that disappeared as we walked toward Jianguomen Wai DaJie.

What does matter is that it has been the capital of the place we now call China for almost all of the past 800 years. As for the south being more typical of where Chinese capitals were based, this is clearly wrong. Nanjing was a capital of China for a tiny amount of time (for one emperor at the start of the Ming and for a decade in the Republican era).

Although Beijing has many nice days (and many bad days) pollution wise, it is very difficult to predict when air quality will be good or bad - making it difficult to plan a trip. In the 1980s, September and October were characterized by predictably beautiful weather so fall was the prime season to visit Beijing. Now, however, even September and October don't have predictably good air. One of the worst bouts of pollution I remember here in Beijing was a few years ago in late October. Spring is also not dependably good. Two days ago, the air quality index spiked to about 560 or so - far, far above what is acceptable by WHO standards. Summer tends to be fairly bad (muggy, polluted and still) and late fall and parts of winter are often polluted, too. Last December-January saw a stretch of 10 days or so of really bad pollution. In fact, bad air pollution is increasingly common from late October until the air gets really cold - around early to mid-January. So, yes, you can have a nice visit to Beijing if your roll of the dice turns out well. But it's also very possible that the 4-5 days you allot for your visit will be be during a stretch of terrible or merely bad pollution.

I noticed that the ride on some sections of the railroads in China were MUCH smoother than others, and I asked one of the train masters (at least one on each train).  She said to look at the rails.

This strikes at the heart of big government-funded institutions; the system is dedicated to preserving jobs over providing better service for riders.",TalkPolitix,78482469,"New York, NY",5906b3297c459f24986dd004
22333383,"It's an old story.  Maintenance isn't sexy so no one wants to do it.  In coop building it results in emergency repairs to unmaitanied systems that cost double or triple what regular maintenance and replacement would.  It's the same for the MTA.  They'd rather hire a million $$$ man from London and keep doing it over and over again than maintaining the rails and signals on a regular basis and replacing them on a schedule.  As a result, it's an emergency every day and it's expensive not just for the MTA but for the people who have to use public transport to get to work.

Three things not tied into antiquated signaling have conspired to reduce this number:<br/>    (1) changes in passenger riding patterns - there has been a flattening out between rush hours and midday/weekends - fewer passengers in rush hours and more in the other periods.  Back in the sixties, large numbers of trains were routinely sidelined during midday and weekends because they weren't needed.  This probably made overall maintenance easier as equipment wasn't on the road as constantly.  Rush hours are just as crowded today but with fewer TPH needed, until now.<br/>    (2) Passenger behavior - the dwell time at stations has increased.  Observe how long it takes from the first time a conductor tries to close the train's door until it actually leaves the station.  Passengers know they can block doors with impunity and they will be reopened.  This needs to change in order to speed things up and increase capacity.<br/>    (3) Operator behavior - a series of operator-caused accidents over the years resulted in the elimination of routine ""keying-by"" of red signals, allowing trains to (slowly) get closer to each other, generally near stations in rush hour.

It then diverges to 4 separate lines that continue at street level, with the exception of 1 of those lines.<br/><br/>The Green Line also holds the distinction of being the oldest subway in the country, opening it's first section of tunnel in 1897. The original layout has not changed since then. The Boylston Street station claims another dubious honor, the tightest curved section of track for any subway. This leads to a sound all too familiar to Bostonians, the ear-wrenching squeel of metal wheels on metal rails.<br/><br/>The slow pendulum of transportation is finally swinging back towards mass transit after decades of construction focused on highways that bring workers from suburban Boston, around Interstates 95 and 495, to the downtown centers.<br/><br/>A new era of development has created even more demand for reliable, expedient public transit, but the state has failed to keep up with the times.

22327294,"15 years ago met some rail engineers that worked world-wide on various projects, and told me that the MTA administrators were too cheap on modernizing their system with newer and better technologies, and insisted in keeping the old signal system in.  It was a financial boon to old companies that still kept inventory of old components, and to old engineers that were doing the same jobs as decades before.  Now,, I see this on the front page.

22326746,"There will come a day when all of our commuting possibilities will come to a stand still. Gridlock on the roads and subway disruptions. Wait a minute, that day is EVERYDAY! What are we waiting for? Christmas 2035? Better get busy, now.<br/>For it usually takes 10 years to decide whether or not to do something and get the permits, then the contract bids, etc. This process of course should have started at least 20 years ago. What a bunch of losers we are. Our country has truly ended up in the trash bin of history, right where it belongs.<br/>We don't even have trains to most of our airports in this country. We are pathetic. Too many people, all trying to clamour aboard our archaic infrastructure. Can you imagine what it will be like in another 25 years? ",MJ,73928952,MA,5906b3297c459f24986dd004
22326630,"Welcome to US civic engineering.  Here in Boston they are extending a subway line 4-5 miles, on land that already is a RR right of way, so it's graded, etc, appropriately.  it will take 10 years of construction work ... that is, after all the court fights and legal hoohaa and permitting and so on and so forth -- 10 years of hardhats wielding tools.  And at a cost expected to be about $3B,   This comes to about 800 days/mile and $10k/inch.<br/><br/>The Swiss just opened the Gotthard Base Tunnel ... two rail tunnels through granite under the alps.  It is over 35 miles long, took 17 years to build and cost $12B. Or about 177 days/mile and about $5400/inch.<br/><br/>Putting some boxes along/under existing track and wiring them together will probably take until the third coming and cost the aggregate GDP of the Western Hemisphere.<br/><br/>And Trump's famed infrastructure plan ... that will employ one guy, half time, starting at about the time the universe reaches maximum entropy.",Fkastenh,151090,"Medford, MA",5906b3297c459f24986dd004
22327563,"I have lived in both London and Signapore. Our infrastructure is indeed an embaresment. Not only do London trains come every couple of minutes, but the tracks are spotless. People wouldn't have to run and hold the doors if they knew a train was right behind the current one. Singapore is a whole other level of nice, but I won't get into that. What I will say is hat they have doors at the platform that prevent people from falling on the tracks. As the MTA advertises, about 50 people a year die from being hit by a train...that's all preventable with these doors. NY building code stipulates that such change in elevation requires a guard rail, regardless of a 100 ton machine coming at you.",Yev,60908868,New Years,5906b3297c459f24986dd004

In twenty years   And the $15 price of coming into Manhattan over a bridge is up there in the stratosphere beyond outrageous--especially for people who live here and use those bridges every...single...day.    I know there are mystical, magical forces at play here which I can never understand.  But to the layman, these astonishing, backbreaking, outlandish increases seem jaw-droppingly unfair, especially in light of our ability to physically--and oh so lamentably--compare our NYC mass transit experiences with those in other states and countries.

22327540,"As a native New Yorker I mourn the lack of progress in our infrastructure. We have so much talent, tech savvy and brawn in our nation and yet year after decade after decade we have poured trillions into weaponry. A product that makes us less safe as we build more of it and one that has no purpose but destroy and to enrich the few. When are we going to build again?  I can only hope for an awakening. We should have modern trains. New York transit needs an overhaul (LA and SF too). Bullet rail, monorail, and a subway for the premiere city of the world that would be on par with the great subway systems of the world. And subway stations that are modernized as well.
